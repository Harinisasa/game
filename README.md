This project is a simple JavaScript and CSS game. To store the score, I used localStorage.
 
To score it, you have to hover the mouse over the ghost - try to score as much as you can! 
Have fun!

As I used localStorage, the score will be stored in your PC. If you want to clean up, 
you can copy and paste this command in your browser console: "localStorage.clear();". 

Notice: Although the game is working on mobile devices, it's not going to work really well,
because the game is using the mousehover function to score it.
